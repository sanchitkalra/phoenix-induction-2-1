## Phoenix Inductions 2-1

This is my submission for the Phoenix inductions task for 2-1; a webapp made with Next.JS and deployed on Vercel.

There are two routes

1. `/`- this route displays the list of the startups in the Firestore database
2. `/about` - this route displays basic information about the Phoenix Assoc

There's also an API route (`/api/data`) that serves data to the frontend on `GET` requests.
